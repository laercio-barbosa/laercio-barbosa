ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@laercio-barbosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laerciobarbosa/)

I'm a non-static person that like to challenge the processes in order to reach new results or bring those ones said impossible to reality. I like to be the first one to use or apply. Challenges take my attention and curiosity. Technology makes me excited.

Interested in Robotics, ADAS Systems and Autonomous Vehicles, I am also a MsC candidate in Robotics at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo working with Learning Based MPC for Lateral Control. 

With 20+ years of experience, of which 15+ within Automotive Industry, I have worked focused on:
- Improve designs with focus on cost reduction
- Search for new devices/concepts to improve designs
- Propose solutions for engineering problems by the customer's request or observation of their needs
- Root cause analysis of products issues
- Hardware/Software development for embedded systems
- Hardware/Software troubleshooting
- Design software tools

Main Skills:
- Microcontrollers
- C/C++; OOP using C language
- Digital communication (ISO 14230, ModBus, CAN, J1939, Interprocess Communication, etc)
- Hardware simulation tools (SPICE, etc)
- Design of software test tools
- Trobleshooting
- Matlab/Simulink
- System Design
